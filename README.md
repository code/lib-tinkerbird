TinkerBird is a browser native vector database designed for efficient storage and
retrieval of high-dimensional vectors (embeddings). It's query engine, written in
TypeScript, leverages HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexes for fast
vector retrieval. The storage layer utilizes IndexedDB, which could be extended
with an lru-cache.

By co-locating data and embeddings, Tikerbird eliminates the roundtrip and reduces 
reliance on server-side interactions for vector search workloads. With Tinkerbird, 
sensitive data remains local, thus benefiting from vector search, without the associated cost,
compliance and security risks.

TinkerBird uses IndexedDB as it's storage layer, which in turn builds upon Blobs
and LevelDB storage systems. By using Indexeddb, it benefits from IndexedDB's
adoption, stability and familiarity as a native choice for offline first
workflows.

Pair TinkerBird with [TinyLM](https://github.com/wizenheimer/tinylm), its companion client-side inference library for embeddings and text generation â€” run models like DeepSeek, Llama 3.2, and Nomic Embed directly in the browser with zero-cost WebGPU based inference.
